/**
 * Regression guard for the `mcp-assert` CI baseline contract.
 *
 * The `mcp-assert` check (.github/workflows/mcp-assert.yml) spawns the built
 * server over stdio with NO credentials and runs two assertions that must both
 * pass at 100%:
 *
 *   1. `<canary-tool>` returns `isError: true` when credentials are missing.
 *      The canary configured in the workflow is `cwautomate_scripts_list`.
 *   2. An unknown tool returns `isError: true` (the JSON-RPC -32601 baseline).
 *
 * These were previously only enforced by the external CI check, which spawns a
 * binary downloaded from an upstream release. When that download flaked the
 * check went red even though the server was correct, and a genuine source
 * regression (e.g. re-introducing an HTTP transport default, or gating the
 * canary tool behind navigation so it is no longer registered) would only be
 * caught in CI rather than by `npm test`.
 *
 * This suite pins the same contract in-process by driving the real
 * `createMcpServer()` factory through an in-memory transport pair, exactly as
 * an MCP client (and therefore mcp-assert) would.
